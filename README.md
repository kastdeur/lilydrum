# Lilydrum (pipeband-drumming notation)

Somehow, the drums part in lilypond does not cover a notation with only right and left hands 
(also known as Swiss style drum notation).
That is, right is above the line and left is below it.
In the same manner as the bagpipe.ly file included with lilypond, flams and drags are defined as a shortcut.

There has been such a lilypond include file earlier, made by Simon Froger 
(which includes all of the above).
This repository builds on work.
The original file can still be found at [http://lsr.di.unimi.it/LSR/Snippet?id=970](http://lsr.di.unimi.it/LSR/Snippet?id=970).

[His website (French) can be found here](https://simonfroger.wordpress.com/lilypond/caisse-claire-ecossaise/)

This repository has also been converted into a [lyp](https://github.com/noteflakes/lyp) package: [lyp/lilydrum](https://github.com/lyp-packages/lilydrum).


## How to use
---------------------
To make a pipeband drum staff simply use
`\new PipeBandDrumStaff`.
This creates a DrumStaff with a few specific changes.

!! Note that you do not need to use PipeBandDrumStaff to use the rest.

Music needs to be defined in `\drummode`.
You can use every regular drum character (such as `sn` or `bd`), as `d` and `g` are appended to the list.

## Example piece
![preview of the score](./example.preview.png)

This was generated by the following code.

```lilypond
\include "lilydrum.ly"

\header { title = "Standards 6/8" }
\score {
        \new PipeBandDrumStaff {
            \drummode {
                \time 6/8
                \repeat volta 2 {
					\partial 8 d8:32( |
					g8.)[ g16 \drag d8]	d8.[ d16 \drag g8] |
					g8.[ \drag d16 d8]	d8.[ d16 \drag g8] |
					
					\tutti {
						\flam d8. d16 g8	d4.:32( |
						d8.) g16 d8	\flam g4
					}
					
					d8:32( |
					g8.)[ g16 \drag d8]	d8.[ d16 \drag g8] |
					g8.[ \drag d16 d8]	d8.[ d16 \drag g8] |

					
					\tutti{
						\flam d8. d16:64( d8)	\flam d8. d16 \flam g8 |
						d8.:32( d16) \flam g8	\flam d4
					}
				}
            }
        }
    }
```

### Embellishments (Side)
-----------------
Flams and Drags can be added using `\flam` and `\drag`. They can determine whether to be left or right by themselves for simple expressions.
If a certain hand is needed they can be inserted directly by appending `d` or `g` to `flam`,`drag`,..
A `\flam d` is equal to `\flamd d`.

There are currently 4 such shortcuts:
 * `\flam` - A Flam
 * `\drag` - A Drag                                                  
 * `\ruff` - A Ruff
 * `\sruff` - A Swiss Ruff

### Unison Brackets (Side)
------------------
Unison Brackets are triggered using `\dr`. 
They need an endpoint which is defined by `\fr`.

You can use `\tutti` for this aswell.
It takes a music expression which is automagically put under brackets.

Appending `dr` to the `\flam`'s  or `\drag`'s triggers the unison bracket.
e.g. `\flamdr` of `\draggdr`.

### Flourishing (Tenor)
-------------
A few flourishes have been added, most are from the [EUSPBA](http://www.euspba.org/resource/music/EUSPBA_drums_tenorflourishing.pdf):
 * `\flourish`
 * `\splitTheFeather`
 * `\cartWheel`
 * `\up`
 * `\rswipe`
 * `\blfy`   - butterfly
 * `\rblfy`  - reverse butterfly
 * `\rthrow` - throw right
 * `\lthrow` - throw left
 * `\bthrow` - throw both
 * `\rpush`  - push right
 * `\lpush`  - push left
 * `\bpush`  - push both
 * `\andrewStop` - St. Andrew's Stop
 * `\stop`


Scoops have not been implemented correctly yet. (see [GitHub Issue #4](https://github.com/kastdeur/lilydrum/issues/4))
